Simulation-based visual modeling of patterns found in living organisms
has a long history, bridging biology, theoretical studies of
morphogenesis, and computer graphics.



This Virtual reality simulation mainly focus' on the modeling of venation pattern in leaves. 


Together with spiral phyllotaxis and the branching structures of tree architecture, venation patterns are among the most admirable aspects of the natural beauty of plants. 


Venation patterns are strongly correlated with leaf shapes, in the simulation the leaf shape is represented as a prefect square to wrap around a sphere using Mercator projection.


The algorithm used is based on the biologically plausible hypothesis
that venation results from an feedback loop between leaf growth,
placement of auxin sources, and the development of veins.
